'''

Scooby has 3 three integers A, B, and C.

Scooby calls a positive integer special if it is divisible by B and 
it is divisible by C. You need to tell the number of special integers less
 than or equal to A.
A = 12
 B = 3
 C = 2
Output : 2
 The two integers divisible by 2 and 3 and less than or equal to 12 are 6,12.

Hint
We canâ€™t loop, so we can try for another approach, i.e., 
find the lcm(least common multiple) of B and C and find the number of
elements less than equal to A, which is divisible by lcm.
lcm(A,B)=(A*B)/(gcd(A,B))
