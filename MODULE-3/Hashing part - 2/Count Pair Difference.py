'''
You are given an array A of N integers and an integer B.
Count the number of pairs (i,j) such that A[i] - A[j] = B and i â‰  j.

Since the answer can be very large, return the remainder after dividing the count 
with 109+7.

A = [1, 2, 1, 2]
B = 1
output 4
The pair which gives difference as 3 are (2, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3) and (4, 3).
