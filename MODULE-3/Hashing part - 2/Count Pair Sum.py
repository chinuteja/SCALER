'''
You are given an array A of N integers and an integer B. 
Count the number of pairs (i,j) such that A[i] + A[j] = B and i â‰  j.
Since the answer can be very large, return the remainder after dividing the count 
with 109+7.
Note - The pair (i,j) is same as the pair (j,i) and we need to count it only once.
A = [1, 2, 1, 2]
B = 3

The pair which gives sum as 3 are (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3) and (3, 4).
